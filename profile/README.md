**Gaucho Racing - FSAE Electric**

Welcome to the Gaucho Racing Formula SAE Electric (FSAE Electric) team at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB)!

**About Us**

Gaucho Racing is the continuation of a rich history of motorsports in Santa Barbara. Over the years, various teams have come and gone, but our mission is clear: to create something enduring that showcases the engineering and business acumen of UCSB students. We are dedicated to leaving a lasting legacy in the world of high-performance motorsports.

**Our Mission**

FSAE Electric, launched in 2013, represents a cutting-edge addition to the Formula SAE competition. Gaucho Racing aims to enable students to gain hands-on experience in all phases of the engineering process and propel them forward into their careers. As part of UCSBâ€™s official SAE International Student Chapter, our main focus is to participate each year in the Formula SAE Electric Competition. This involves students working to research, design, and manufacture a single seater electric race car from the ground up.

**Repository Overview**

This GitHub repository serves as the central hub for all the software developed in-house by our talented UCSB team members for high-performance motorsports. Here, you'll find all of our code, algorithms, and projects that power our competitive electric vehicles.
